# Number datatype in python is very strong in comparision to other languages

# we have basic arithmatic operations
# + - * / % **(divide ka result kesa chie us base pr single divivde aur double divide use krlete hai)

# next if u want to see about operation precedence google it(in real world it is of no use)
# we should always perform operations on same datatypes to make the code more readiable
